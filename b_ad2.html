  <h2>Standard mode</h2>

  <p>The <tt>##.back300ad</tt> rule would cause this item to be hidden, but it contains more than 5 words and so it is granted an exception and made <b>visible</b>:</li>
    <ol>
      <li class="back300ad">An item which is much longer than most</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <p>The <tt>##.badge-gag-ads-container</tt> rule will cause this item to be <b>hidden</b> because even though it's longer than 5 words, it pulls in a cross-origin image:
    <ol>
      <li class="badge-gag-ads-container">Item that is a little bit longer than 5 words, but with cross-origin image: <img src="https://fmarier.org/favicon.ico"></li>
    </ol>
