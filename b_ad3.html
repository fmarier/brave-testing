  <h2>Agressive mode</h2>

  <p>All test cases should be <b>hidden</b>.</p>

  <h2>Standard mode</h2>

  <p>The <tt>##.b_ad</tt> rule will cause this item to be <b>hidden</b>:
    <ol>
      <li class="b_ad">Item</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <p>The <tt>##.back300ad</tt> rule would cause the first and second items to be hidden, but the second contains more than 5 words and so it grants an exception to the entire rule, making all items <b>visible</b>:</li>
    <ol>
      <li class="back300ad">First item</li>
      <li class="back300ad">Second item, which is much longer than the first one</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <p>The <tt>##.badge-gag-ads-container</tt> rule will cause this item to be <b>hidden</b> because even though it's longer than 5 words, it pulls in a cross-origin image:
    <ol>
      <li class="badge-gag-ads-container">Item that is a little bit longer than 5 words, but with cross-origin image: <img src="https://fmarier.org/favicon.ico"></li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <p>The <tt>##.bank-rate-ad</tt> rule would cause this short item to be hidden, but it pulls in a same-origin image and gets exempted so it's <b>visible</b>:
    <ol>
      <li class="bank-rate-ad">Image: <img src="brave.png"></li>
    </ol>
  </p>
